# Unit conversions

## Position

The position of the motor's internal encoder is read in native units of [`[rotations of motor]`](https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/sparkrelativeencoder#getPosition()).
>```java
>public double getPosition()
>```
>Get the position of the motor. This returns the native units of 'rotations' by default, and can be changed by a scale factor using `setPositionConversionFactor()`.

The parameter we pass to [`setPositionConversionFactor()`](https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/sparkrelativeencoder#setPositionConversionFactor(double)) will need to have units of `[desired unit]/[native unit]`.

Our desired unit for controlling the position of the climber actuator is `[in of actuator travel]`. So we need to calculate the conversion factor `[in of actuator travel]/[rotations of motor]`.

Knowns:
- Pulley reduction = `36 [rotations of motor] / 24 [rotations of threaded rod]`
- Pitch of threaded rod = `10 [rotation of threaded rod] / 1 [in of actuator travel]`

Assembling these by unit analysis, we get:

```java
public static final double kGearRatio = 36.0 / 24.0; // pulley ratio
public static final double kPitch = 10.0; // turns per inch

public static final double kPositionConversionFactor =
  1.0 / (kGearRatio * kPitch); // inches per rotation
```

## Velocity

The velocity of the motor's internal encoder is read in native units of [[RPM of motor]](https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/sparkrelativeencoder#getVelocity()).
>```java
>public double getVelocity()
>```
>Get the velocity of the motor. This returns the native units of 'RPM' by default, and can be changed by a scale factor using setVelocityConversionFactor().

The parameter we pass to [`setVelocityConversionFactor()`](https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/sparkrelativeencoder#setVelocityConversionFactor(double)) will need to have units of [desired unit]/[native unit].

Our desired unit for controlling the velocity of the climber actuator is `[in/s of actuator travel]`. So we need to calculate the conversion factor `[in/s of actuator travel]/[RPM of motor]`.

Knowns:
- `kPositionConversionFactor` is in units of `[in of actuator travel]/[rotations of motor]`
- `60 [s]` = `1 [m]`

Assembling these by unit analysis, we get:

```java
public static final double kVelocityConversionFactor =
  kPositionConversionFactor / 60.0; // inches per second
```

# Maximum speed and acceleration

## Maximum velocity

Our desired unit for controlling the velocity of the climber actuator is `[in/s of actuator travel]`.

Knowns:
- `kVelocityConversionFactor` is in units of `[in/s of actuator travel]/[RPM of motor]`
- Free speed of a REV NEO motor is approximately [`5880 [RPM]`](https://www.reca.lc/motors)
- We would like to operate the climber actuator at a maximum speed of approximately 80% of the motor's free speed (an arbitrary choice)

Assembling these by unit analysis, we get:

```java
public static final double kRapidMaxVelocity = (0.8 * 5880.0) * kVelocityConversionFactor;
```

## Maximum acceleration

Our desired unit for controlling the acceleration of the climber actuator is `[in/s^2 of actuator travel]`.

Knowns:
- `kRapidMaxVelocity` is in units of `[in/s of actuator travel]`
- We would like to accelerate to the maximum speed in approximately `0.25 [s]` (an arbitrary choice)

Assembling these by unit analysis, we get:

```java
public static final double kRapidMaxAcceleration = kRapidMaxVelocity / 0.25;
```
